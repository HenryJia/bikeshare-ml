My machine learning implementations for the bikesharing competition on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand

The latest implementation of the algorithm and best is in neural 2

It's a neural network with sigmoid unction as its activation and the Y rescaled to between 0 and 1 so that it can be used by the neural network.

The errors in prediction are as follows

JA =  5502.1
JB =    1.4910e+04
JAValidate =  4954.1
JBValidate =    1.3835e+04
